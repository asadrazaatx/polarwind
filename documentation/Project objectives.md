# Project objectives

1. First class accessibility support for screen readers and keyboard interaction (escaping
   out of menus, arrow keys, focus states for tab navigation)
2. First class support for mobile with appropriate design for small screens, respecting
   dark mode and reduced motion.
3. Excellent documentation and interactive examples.
4. Every component must be deliveried with comprehensive visual and accessibility testing
   for components.
5. A realistic host application that uses the component to validate that the pieces fit
   together as a whole.
6. Components are built to cover just enough of what we currently need instead of being
   fully featured. As more use cases emerge, we will add more capabilities and
   customization to the respective components.
